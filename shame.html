        <p>
            A learned inner verdict that convinces a person their existence is the mistake.
It is the quiet belief that something essential about oneself is defective, excessive, or unwanted — not because of a single action, but because of who they are when seen.
Shame teaches a person to monitor themselves constantly, to shrink before being rejected, to apologize before being accused. It speaks in self-corrections and silences, persuading them that safety comes from disappearing, not from being understood.
