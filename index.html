            <h1>Information</h1>
            <p>
                Froylan Fahlan Aditya, known online as Liam Dunbar, is an 18-year-old from Indonesia.
                He has a calm but introspective presence. He speaks Indonesian and English with a preference
                for a UK accent, and he’s currently learning German. His heart is drawn to Austria and Germany —
                places he dreams of living in someday.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Fahlan Aditya is a quiet soul with many storms inside. He grew up being told to silence his emotions,
                but deep down he feels everything — maybe too much. His past carved wounds that never fully healed.
                He calls himself “a boy made of water and soil,” fragile yet undeniably real.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Though life has been cruel, Fahlan has a beauty in him that doesn’t fade: his empathy.
                He sees pain in others even when no one else notices. He protects the broken, the lonely,
                the forgotten. That’s how his heart works: raw, human, protective.
            </p>
